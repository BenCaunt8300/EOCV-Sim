# Welcome!

EOCV-Sim (EasyOpenCV Simulator) is a straightforward way to test your pipelines in a 
simple user interface directly in your computer, simulating entirely the EasyOpenCV library & the 
FTC SDK structure, allowing you simply to copy paste directly your pipeline code once you want to 
transfer it onto your robot!

# Installation

No complicated setup is required, straight up importing the project into Intellij IDEA:

1) **Download & install the Java Development Kit if you haven't already:**<br/><br/>
      JDK 12 is the most tested with the Sim, but any JDK > 8 will probably work fine.<br/>
      You can download JDK 12 from [the Oracle webpage](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk12-archive-downloads.html)<br/><br/>
      I found [this step by step videp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBVWIVeIa-E) of the JDK installation process

2) **Download & install Intellij Idea Community IDE if you haven't already:**<br/><br/>
      You can download it from the JetBrains webpage (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)<br/><br/>
      Here is another [great step by step video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2okEJIbUYs) I found
     
3) **Clone and import the project:** <br/><br/>
      Open Intellij Idea
